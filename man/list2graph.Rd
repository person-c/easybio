\title{Convert a Named List into a Graph Based on Overlap}
\usage{
list2graph(nodes)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{A named list where each element is a vector.}
}
\value{
A data.table representing the graph, with columns for the node names
(\code{node_x} and \code{node_y}) and the weight of the edge (\code{weight}).
}
\description{
This function creates a graph from a named list, where the edges are determined
by the overlap between the elements of the list. Each node in the graph represents
an element of the list, and the weight of the edge between two nodes is the number
of overlapping elements between the two corresponding lists.
